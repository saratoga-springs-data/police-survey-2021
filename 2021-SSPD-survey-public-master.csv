I have 100% trust and confidence in those who serve on the force but have deep concerns that their effectiveness has been limited due to unqualified administrators.  This is evidenced by the repeated blocking of a critical hospital route by protestors during a public health crisis despite emergency meetings assuring residents that this would no longer be tolerated.  I have always been treated with fairness and respect but in order to carry this conception to the community, policies, expectations, and actions need to be clearly communicated and enforced consistently in all circumstances.  For example, if you block streets you will be removed, if you are sleeping on the sidewalk you will be escorted to a place that provides services, if you are under the influence you will be taken somewhere to detox.  My perception is that Robin Dalton has larger political aspirations and a lack of qualifications and that she has failed to protect our community or support our police by allowing them to do their jobs because she doesn't want to upset a vocal group.

While there has been very little interaction with police - the interaction has been pleasant. However there was one issue when my son was with a group of friends and my son being the only one of color was specifically called out and questioned / for NO reason. Had he done something to cause that questioning believe me  I would be the first one to discipline him. As a teenager it bothered him greatly and it bothered his friends. It sends a message that is hard to reverse and completely unnecessary. As a parent I stick up for police - reminding my kids to obey ALWAYS- as they should a teacher or a coach. It is difficult to explain that to a child. Thank you for addressing this. ,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,0,0,4,4,3,5,2,3,5,2,2,5,4,Remove racist cops. ,No

The man had started a fight inside the bar (I remember specifically a man almost opened his stall in the bathroom and he tried to fight the guy). The officer had incredible respect and gave space for this man, never touching him just pointing and encouraging him to proceed down the street, as the man was pushing and screaming profanities. In a similar situation, I saw a cop roughing and arresting a black individual who was rowdy leaving a bar. This black man was not nearly as brash as the white man in the incident mentioned above. In these incidents the white man was louder, violent and overall a bigger concern for public safety. Whereas the black individual who was similarly rowdy in a bar, he was forcibly removed. This to me shows that if you're rowdy and white on Caroline street, you'll be kindly encouraged to leave on your own accord as you scream profanities, but if you're black and rowdy on Caroline street you'll be immediately forcibly removed.

The city of Saratoga springs, as well as the commissioner of public safety and the SSPD have not taken any accountability or offered any apologies for lying to the citizens of this city. The community also has no idea where this case stands, there is a complete void of information. It smells like a coverup.

The only people who do not believe this are the people whom the police actually protect. The women I know who have been in abusive relationships have been in abusive relationships with men who are cops or men who are friends with cops. Cops who saw the abuse and supported it, who protected the abuser. I think this speaks to the type of people who become cops. This past year, Saratoga Police officers were frequently on duty in public and pulling people over without masks and improperly masked, during a global pandemic and health crisis. This not only qualifies as doing the opposite of the oath to PROTECT and serve but is also an act of intimidation seeing as it is actively putting anyone they interacted with in danger. In light of the fact that the force did have break out of covid-19, this should be evident. How long were officers contagious and on duty, unmasked, before testing positive or developing symtoms? There is also the response made by police on Thursday, July 30, 2020, to a peaceful protest. The sudden show of tanks, gear, numbers, and the use of tear gas and police horses, falls under all categories of physical mistreatment, harassment, and intimidation. The fact that this coincided with both the back the blue rally and the upcoming return of the racetrack tourist season makes this show of force evident of who the police are actually protecting: the conservative, the rich, and white, whether they are from Saratoga or not.

I have experienced and witnessed SSPD respond to challenging situations with great sensitivity, patience and compassion.  I have also witnessed unnecessary intimidation which sometimes escalated situations. I have also witnessed very different attitude from officers depending on whom they are interacting with. Young people, especially if Black or brown, are bullied and intimidated, and women, especially if Black are brown, condescended to, not taken seriously, met with hostility. Friends have asked me to be a white witness when they call police or have to go to station, believing they will be treated better in my presence.    We are fortunate that we do not have a lot of violent crimes in our city. Most are related to alcohol, drugs and domestic violence.  We need fewer officers and unarmed officers.  We need civilian oversight to review and investigate confidential complaints.  We need transparency of police misconduct on and off duty. People who are paid to protect our community and have access to weapons, must be held to the highest standard of conduct (e.g, domestic violence is unacceptable, FB posts mocking protestors is unacceptable). Military style uniform, gear, vehicles and  tactics should be banned.  We are civilians - we are peacefully demonstrating - we are not the enemy. We are not at war.",No

I would also continue strong relationships with other police agencies and enter into agreements with them for mutual aid.  I believe that the protection of life and property of all Saratogians should be the department's main prioritiies and submit that this is best accomplished by working closely with other agencies such as the Sheriffs and state police when circumstances necessitate.  I feel that the department needs more, not less funding.  We have all seen the spike in crime in cities across the country where so-called ""defund the police"" policies have been enacted.    I have no objection to working with the community and encourage it to the fullest extent possible.  What I have seen is an unwillingness on the side of certain persons/groups to be reasonable in the process.  I would strongly suggest that any would-be member of a civilian advisory committee be mandated to go on a ride-along with SSPD for a month in the summer to witness firsthand what police officers are faced with on a daily basis before they are allowed to suggest rule changes.  I would encourage more active recruitment efforts targeting minority members of the community.

I've lived in this town since I arrived at Skidmore College in 1976. I am a well known Designer and House Restorator. I was pulled over by a young cocky police officer, I will never forget his face or name, for a minor traffic violation 2 blocks from my home at 8 pm and presumed drunk. When i admitted (I've been told, since, I should've lied to the cop) to taking a legal drug for anxiety earlier that day, it was the end of me!! After walking the line and waiting out in zero degree temps with a female officer from a second car (i must have been a clear and present danger ??!!!!)  I was arrested and put in the back of his police car for what he said was a DWAI. I was dumbfounded and in shock . I spent 1 hour there handcuffed to his desk ( REALLY??? ) while I tried to reach my Lawyer and while he typed up lies about me to print in the police blotter ( that needs to be abolished ...basically defamation with no proof!!) Then I was handcuffed , hands behind my back as if I were a criminal, and was hauled off to Saratoga Hospital for a drug and alcohol test . By 12 midnight I was home, could have walked from police station but my lawyer also a block from the station dropped me at home. Oh yeah...my Car had been impounded !! And If it all that wasn't enough trauma, reading about myself in the paper  the next day as a DRUGGED DRIVER was life altering.  Next came... insane Lawyers fees, standing before a Judge ( a dear friend of mine) and waiting 6 months for a Lab to tell me there was nothing in my system !! While waiting for my negative test , I NEVER for a second doubted that outcome, I reached out to one of the leading prosecutors for NYState ( another friend of mine) to sue the Saratoga Police Dept. for false arrest and defamation and he told me the Saratoga  Police Dept. were the toughest in New York State and I would get nowhere. Hmmmmmm....... That was 3 years ago and it still wrecks me to talk about it. But more importantly it left a mark on a reputation that took 40 years for me to build in this community. I know I am white, and I am privileged ...now i can really imagine what it would be like to be neither of those. I am an outspoken female for Change with  all  Police and their Policing systems....They are there to protect and serve us??

When in 2021 your 6 year old black daughter speculates if the reason they are being treated differently or unfairly is because of the color of her skin, there is a BIG problem. The SSPD needs to work towards making sure that all people, but especially our brown and black neighbors feel safe and understood. Until those in charge of this city begin doing the REAL work of understanding the very deep racial structures and ancestral traumas that automatically create a hierarchy nearly impossible to overcome for brown and black folx than nothing is ever going to change.

Saratoga Springs is a small community that can set a precedent for a new way of envisioning police activity in this country. I have seen first-hand police officers being ineffective at handling domestic disputes in my neighborhood. I have also been afraid to call the police when there is a clear domestic dispute happening in my neighborhood (such as someone being prevented from entering a home and creating a scene on the street, throwing garbage cans) because I do not trust the police to respond in a safe, appropriate manner nor do I trust the police have been properly trained to have everyone's best interests in mind, and I fear that I could be further endangering someone's life by calling police to the scene. I have also been approached by police who do not wear a mask; police officers are not setting good examples in this town, which makes them even less trustworthy. We need to be able to trust the person who shows up to an emergency call; if I knew a social worker would respond to a 911 call, I would be much more inclined to confidently report potentially violent behavior/property-damaging behavior in my neighborhood. Further, the behavior of police at peaceful Black Lives Matter protests (particularly in November and last summer) has been horrendous. Gearing up for a riot with riot gear in a peaceful standoff (as happened in November) only serves to make protestors fear for their lives and well-being and demonstrates that police are looking for a physical altercation. Police should remain peaceful in their demeanor and in how they dress/what they carry. Calling in County Sheriff backup and allowing violence to ensure was truly horrendous. The SSPD needs to acknowledge and apologize for antagonistic actions in the past year and previously. The SSPD needs to publicly acknowledge its own bias and incidents of racist behavior - whether microaggressions or larger-scale fatal encounters like that with Darryl Mount. The SSPD needs to reckon with these issues if it is to ever earn the trust of the Saratoga Springs community. I would like to the SSPD involved in restorative justice initiatives as a way to begin this reckoning and rebuilding of trust, in addition to dramatic changes in the police force (such as the inclusion of social workers in responding to most calls).",No

My other suggestion is that we do need a civilian committee that is charged with the authority and public trust to investigate incidents that involve complaints about the SSPD. They should have access to the police reports and any information that helps them make a report and recommendations,which should be available to the public. When I read that Veitch testified that he had lied about conducting an internal investigation into the Daryl Mount case,it totally broke my trust with the SSPD leadership and therefore, the SSPD , and  made the need for a civilian investigative group obvious. Afterwards, I read in a newspaper article that one of the young officers involved in the Daryl Mount incident, had become one of the highest promoted police officers for his age group. I think that with more public awareness through a civilian committee about this fatal police incident,perhaps his subsequent promotions would have been more closely scrutinized. ",No

I know people of color have had a different experience.  I can say that wherever I have personally called on the SSPD they have been very helpful, courteous and a pleasure to deal with.  To improve the SSPD I would enact a policy which mandates that whenever a SSPD Officer is involved in an interaction with a civilian that results in serious physical injury or death there is an automatic autonomous, independent investigation by an outside agency. This would eliminate all possible appearances of any possible improprieties by anyone - the SSPD, the city, etc.   About a decade ago the FBI published a report that found that police agencies all across the US had been infiltrated by the KKK and other white nationalist groups. It should be mandated that EVERY officer be investigated to ascertain if s/he had ever been a member of such a group. If so, s/he would be dismissed immediately. Every new officer should be investigated for this background as well.  Qualified Immunity should be absolutely removed. Yes I understand that police officers sometimes have to make split second life and death decisions; so do cardiologists and many other medical personnel and they don't have Qualified Immunity.

My personal experience with the officers of the SSPD has been excellent and I have found  those I've interacted with to be effective, courteous and professional. However, 8 police vehicles appeared in succession one afternoon at downtown P.Chopper due to the presence of an older man who appeared to be an alcoholic or under the influence but alone and clearly unwell.  I had come out of the store a few minutes earlier and was walking over to my car across the street.  The first officer on the scene carried a very large gun and appeared to scare the man-- it may just have been from his harsh tone of voice which I heard, I did not hear the words.  When the officer spoke to him, he crumpled and fell against the doorway or other exterior of the building.  the officer stayed there for the 10 minutes I did, perhaps waiting for someone to come get the man, whom I am sure the department was familiar with like so many others,   He certainly did no appear to pose any threat whatsoever to anyone,  and did not warrant any aggressive behavior or words to my  untrained layperson eyes, and even I felt intimidated as so many patrol cars continued to pull up and park as though this was a major crime scene. I became afraid something might go wrong with so many responding to what appeared to be so little.  I also wondered why so many officers were so close by and attributed it to a quiet day or new shift just starting, but they continued to show up, apparently  without receipt of communication to the contrary.    I suspect a nearby resident complained of the mere presence of this person.  But absent the commission of a crime I believe a person residing downtown should expect and share the public right of way with others and respect that person, and tolerate and help if possible, even if it is by saying hello and walking on.  I feel strongly that there  are too many police patrolling this city,  Even when I rented on Ludlow Street officers went by multiple times a day at all times of the year.

I have watched this gem of a city grow and evolve over the last 35+ years.  I enjoy several circles of friends of multiethnic and religious backgrounds and revere the cultural richness this community offers.  When I read the article about Police Reform and then viewed this survey, I am very dismayed by what seems to be a dubious attempt to sabotage a well-run police department. To put it plainly, this survey and this committee are absolutely absurd. It is clear that the members of the committee who wrote this survey have no experience in developing unbiased opinion surveys.  Additionally, it is clear that some of the organizers of this committee are new the Saratoga Springs community.  They just don't seem qualified as newcomers without a view from the past and continuing richness and fairness this community offers, and its evolution.  They are unaware of how absolutely INCLUSIVE this community has been to people of all races, religions, wealth and gender identifiers for several decades since I have lived here.  We do not have a diversity problem in Saratoga Springs or anywhere in the region. Just because the Governor says we should examine our city's Police Department, does not mean a problem exists.  We are a city of laws and rules.  If you break the rules and you are caught by the police, then you are charged. And the SSPD has an excellent track record of doing so. There is no difference whether you are white or brown or black.  No one gets a ""pass"" because of the Black Lives Matters campaign.  In fact, that riot downtown was insulting to the BLM campaign which has shed light on some very legitimate systemic concerns in this country. No, instead this group decided to grab national headlines and try to make a demeaning issue of our Police Department. Watch, some of them will likely try to run for office!  SHAME ON YOU! This group sees Saratoga through a convenient lense that attempts to make an issue where one does not exist.  I know what DID exist:  A group of thugs that went around harassing people enjoying dinner on outdoor patios of our local restaurants; SUPPORTING our local business community.  Another group of thugs blocked hospitals.  A group of thugs that disrupted traffic along our main thoroughfare.  A group of thugs that left a path of damage and litter in the wake of their ""demonstrations"".  And these thugs got away with it all while taxpayers foot the bill to clean up their path of destruction and business owners comped free deserts to make up for the embarrassment this group caused. Our police department conducted themselves entirely appropriately this summer protecting the vast majority of taxpaying citizens that do not see the world through the same polluted views of the few, imported protesters that assembled downtown and developed this committee.  In fact, that was less of a protest as it was a riot.  Most of them couldn't even agree what they were allegedly protesting when asked by the media!   What this group needs to realize is that their rhetoric is inciteful.  They need to hire a professional agency to create an honest, unbiased survey.  Better yet, disband!  A city that invented ""Leap of Kindness Day"" cannot also have racial disparity problem.  The facts are not in this committee's favor.   ",Yes

I am shocked by the wording at the start of this survey that leads people to believe that there aren't already these policies in place. The beginning of the survey states ""which of the following changes"", implying that deescalation, for example, isn't already a part of police training.  As I understand it, Stop & Frisk is illegal in most places.  As I stated in my write-in answer, I worked with children with mental illness who often couldn't be calmed by a team (not all at once) of highly trained social workers and educators. More than a few times, the police were called and they had a powerful and calming presence with the children. It spoke volumes to the need for authority, which sometimes in special education of students with behavior issues leads to bending over backwards to accommodate them, leading to- sometimes- a perceived lack of authority that the children can manipulate. I worry about our society as there is a continued decline in respect for police who deal with such difficult responsibilities.  Adding social workers to 911 response teams isn't something I would oppose, but the overall biased tone of this survey against police is wrong.",Yes

With that said, at the little ""walking man"" signal I walked slowly across Lake Ave at City Hall so as to prevent a jerky man from making a right turn onto Lake (long story). There were 2 cops there and they berated me for at least 20 minutes, with another cop pulling up in their car with the lights flashing to join the pile-on. I shouldn't have been an ass, no doubt, and I should have been told not to be an ass, also no doubt, but to this day I think 20 minutes of being hollered at by 2 and then 3 police officers was a bit much. I'm guessing actual criminals were committing actual crimes at that very moment and could have used some enforcement of laws. Ultimately, I was scared straight and went cold turkey shortly after that and have been sober since. Hooray for that!  All these years later and I still think that embarrassing idiots who aren't technically committing crimes should be lower on the list of priorities.
